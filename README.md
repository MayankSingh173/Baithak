# Baithak 👩‍👩‍👧‍👦 

This is a multi-video calling android app made during the [Microsoft Engage Mentorship Programs 2021](https://microsoft.acehacker.com/engage2021/?mc_cid=70edf59e1b&mc_eid=a6934c0683). The theme of the program is to build a Microsoft teams clone with **Agile software development methodology**.

*Baithak is a Hindi word that means* "**Meeting**"

So baithak is a **multi-video calling app** where people can connect virtually through video calls and would able to do conversations with other users. The can also schedule tasks and meetings with other members too.

## 🚩 How I used agile software development methodology in my project💻?

The core theme of the Microsoft mentorship program is the **Agile software development methodology**. Agile is a methodology adopted today in the software industry which promotes teamwork, flexible procedures, and a sle-organizing team. 

How I achieved agile methodology?

- As the project is made by an individual i.e. me with the support of mentors, so I first considered myself as a team. 
- As in Agile methodology, the development cycle is broken down into Sprints (1/2 weeks), so I've chosen **1 week** as a sprint and divided tasks📌 according.

    - **Sprint 1 (Research Phase)** - 14/06/21 - 21/06/21 
    
        - [x]  Research on the implement of Video call from different libraries
        - [x]  Have a meet with mentors and ask necessary doubts.
        - [x]  Basic overview of how your app should work and look like
    
    - **Sprint 2 (Development Phase I)** - 21/06/21 - 29/06/21 
    
        - [x]  Setup the react native project and add git and upload to github.
        - [x]  Add theme - dark and light theme
        - [x]  Add firebase and implement Authentications with firebase
        - [x]  Main Navigation
        - [x]  Implement Video between two people

    - **Sprint 3 (Development Phase II)** - 28/06/21 - 05/07/21 
    
        - [x]  Make a proper UI of Video Stream Screen.
        - [x]  Add a logic for join meeting (waiting list, host join)
        - [x]  Bug Fixes
            - [x]  Google SignIn developer error
            - [x]  ScrollView of Authentication Screens
            - [x]  Local Video not showing
            - [x]  Not able to update while joining meet
            - [x]  Mute Video and Mute video not working 
        - [x]  Add message to current meeting
        - [x]  Make a profile screen
        - [x]  Make a Search bar
        - [ ]  Schedule a meeting and add participants during create meet
        - [ ]  If time permits...try deep links to share meet

    - **Sprint 3 (Development Phase III along with Adopt phase)** - 05/07/21 - 12/07/21 
    
        - [x]  Make a adopt feature
        - [x]  Add notifications in the chat and baithak
        - [x]  Make a edit profile screen
        - [x]  Add calendar along with task
        - [x]  Add calendar along with agenda
        - [x]  Group chat header modal
        - [x]  New user should have their notifications on
        - [x]  Add onboarding Screens.
        - [x]  Make a video for submission and create a Readme.md file
        


- From the very starting of my development phase, I started using **git** and **github** for managing my project. This is my first time extensively using git and github. 

    For every new feature, I created a separate branch, did my code on that branch. And after writing the code and testing, I made a pull request and merged it with my `master`

- The **testing phase** comes after creating every new feature. This is one of the most challenging tasks for me. As there is a feature of multi-video calling and chats along with notifications, I usually took **2-3 phones** for testing. After I was satisfied with the feature and fixed all the necessary bugs I made a new `release-apk` and upload it under the release section of github.  


I would like to thank [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Github](https://github.com/), without them I couldn't able to achieve agile software development methodology.

## 🚩 Why I choose this tech stack?
[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) is an open-source **mobile application framework** created by Facebook which allows creating of native apps with a single code base and can run on multi-platforms like android and ios. It allows to write code once and use it again as a component. I have past experience with this technology and this was my first choice for creating this project. Since I have a windows machine, I've developed only an android app with this cross-platform technology. 

[Firebase](https://rnfirebase.io/)  is serverless technology backed by Google which offers features like **firestore database, authentication, storage, cloud messaging, etc**. In the initial sprint, I thought of having features like authentication, notifications, and chats. All these features can **easily be implemented with minimalistic API calls provide by firebase**. So firebase seems to have a great fit for my app. 

[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) is a javascript state management library that allows creating of a centralized store and powerful capabilities like undo/redo, state persistence, and much more. **Before this project, I didn't have experience with this library and was afraid to incorporate this into my projects because of the slight complexity of implementing it (this is what I feel). But now I'm more confident with this library. This is surely one of my great learning through this project.**

[Agora](https://www.agora.io/en/) is a real-time communication service that provides features like video calling, voice calling, chat messaging, and many more. As I've used react native as a frontend framework, agora provides video SDKs for react-native through their library `react-native-agora`. **I have also explored other libraries and APIs like [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/), [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/), [`react-native-jitsi-meet`](https://github.com/skrafft/react-native-jitsi-meet) and [Vonage API](https://www.vonage.com/communications-apis/). Except for WebRTC all other SDKs/library/APIs doesn't provide that much flexibility according to my needs. The WebRTC can provide features like agora but I feel relatively difficult in implementing.**

The app is backed with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) server hosted on Heroku.
